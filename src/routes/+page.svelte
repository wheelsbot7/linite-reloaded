	<h1>About this app</h1>

	<p>
		This is a <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev">SvelteKit</a> app. It was originally integrated into
		an <a href="https://astro.build">Astro</a> static site, but the level of interactivity necessary
		required a more isolated sandbox, so now it's here. Check it out at the tab up top. Or, if you want
		to know more, click the Svelte logo.
